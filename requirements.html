			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>The UC San Diego Chapter of Tau Beta Pi conducts two Initiations per academic year. Invitations to eligible students are mailed out during Weeks 3 and 4 of the Fall and Winter academic quarters to students in the <b>top 1/8th of the Junior class</b> and <b>top 1/5th of the Senior class</b>. For students to have Junior Class standing, they must have completed 90-135 units. To qualify for Senior Class standing, students must have completed over 135 units. After invitations are sent out, info sessions are held for the the invited students to inform them about the initiation process to become a member. During the Initiation Cycle (approximately a 10 week period), we look for two main things when electing new members into TBP. The first is academic excellence, which all of you have obviously attained. The second, and perhaps the more important of the two, is outstanding character. In order to better judge this, we would like to get to know you better. Thus, we ask that you submit a candidate packet with some information about yourself, as well as participate in events with our members. After reviewing your packets, we will conduct individual interviews. At this point, we will invite those people who we feel exemplify the qualities we are looking for to initiate into TBP. <b>Once you initiate, you are a lifetime member.</b></p>

					<h3><u>Interviews</u></h3>
					<p>Interviews will be scheduled. These are primarily an opportunity for the Tau Beta Pi members to get to know you, but will also be used to assess your character and what you may bring to the organization. It is important that the information packet be turned in on time so that the members can learn about you before the interview. We will schedule interviews by e-mail during the weeks prior to the interviews. Business attire is required.

				<section>
					<h3><u>Initation Ceremony</u></h3>
					<p><b>Initiation is mandatory!</b> Any eligible initiate unable to make it to initiation will not be able to initiate this term! Business attire is required for this event. <b>A one-time lifetime membership fee of $100</b> (made payable to “UCSD Tau Beta Pi”) is due on the night of Initiation. This fee covers chapter operating costs, dues to TBP national headquarters, cost of Initiation materials, and the initiate banquet.
					The date of the Initiation Ceremony for the Winter Cycle is <b>Friday, January 30, 2015</b>.
