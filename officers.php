              Hi, I’m Tiffany. I am a fifth year Computer Science Bioinformatics major. On weekends and most nights you'll probably find me in a gym, at the beach, or at a park playing volleyball. After volleyball, my greatest passions in life are food and books. I highly recommend reading Name of the Wind if you're a fan of scifi. I love sea turtles and have high hopes of riding one in the ocean one day.

              Hello! I am Kristine Tan aka k7tan and I will be serving as the Co-President of TBP. I am currently a 5th year Bioengineering: Biotechnology major finishing up my GEs so I can graduate and get outta here to fight my way through the real world (or graduate school). When I'm not in class, studying, or at an awesome TBP event, I love playing tennis and eating so if you enjoy either of those we'll get along just fine. If not, that's ok, we can still be friends :) I love making new friends. And an extra fun fact about me is that one of my greatest fears is going to sleep and not waking up...on time. I need several alarms to get me out of bed each and every morning/noon.

              Hey! I'm Joseph To your MAE Representative. I'm a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering (and Physics I guess) student. If I'm not spending time "studying" for classes, I'm probably running, watching my football team lose, or playing soccer; I'm not very good at it. </h5>

              I'm Thomas! Im a third year Chemical Engineering student who will be your go to guy for Nano/Ceng related concerns. We even have Nano Engineers at UCSD? Anyways, I spend most of my time at Blacks Beach, slacklining at Peterson Loop, or swimming on UCSD's new Club Swim Team! Or just in Geisel like the rest of TBP. My biggest passion in life is sports, and at one point I was playing 7 of them at once.            </h5>

Hello, I'm Carolina and I am the SE Representative for TBP, aka the lone wolf of TBP. I am a 4th year Structural Engineering student and I'm also doing a math minor. When I am not staring at the moon, I am at the SME computer lab trying to find reasons to not do my homework. While being the lone wolf of TBP is super cool and all, I am currently recruiting SE students to join my wolf pack so if you're in SE you should join TBP! (everyone should join TBP, but SE students especially).            </h5>
