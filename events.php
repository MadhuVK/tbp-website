        <b> <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/uxkEPb1GRc">2015 Spring Conference RSVP</b></a> <br />
        District 16 of Tau Beta Pi (which consists of Southern California and Las Vegas) is having their annual Spring Conference on April 18th at Loyola Marymount University. Spring Conference is a workshop meant to help improve leadership skills and chapters in general, and is geared towards current officers (to share their wisdom) and future officers (to apply said wisdom). Attendance at this conference is highly recommended for anyone thinking of becoming an officer next year. This is one of the few opportunities for you to meet members from other chapters and even officers from TBP headquarters! 
This is a full-day event, beginning around 9am until approximately 5:30pm, with optional dinner immediately following.
You must <b>RSVP by 11:59pm on Tuesday, April 7th</b> if you are interested in going.

        <b>Non-TBP Hosted Events for Points</b> <br />
        Events not hosted by Tau Beta Pi or not listed on our calendar, 
        may still be eligible for points. In order to receive points for these events, 
        members and/or initiates must write a one-page write up of the event, 
        including an event description as well as why you believe it should count 
        as an event and how it follows TBP's goals. A picture must also be shown as 
        proof of event attendance. You will then need to email the write-up to an officer 
        for approval before getting the points signed off and just include the picture with that. 
        And then once you've written that and after the officers have approved it, you can bring your
        point sheet to the next event you attend and have an officer sign your form then.
