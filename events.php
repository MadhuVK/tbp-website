        <b>Non-TBP Hosted Events for Points</b> <br />
        Events not hosted by Tau Beta Pi or not listed on our calendar, 
        may still be eligible for points. In order to receive points for these events, 
        members and/or initiates must write a one-page write up of the event, 
        including an event description as well as why you believe it should count 
        as an event and how it follows TBP's goals. A picture must also be shown as 
        proof of event attendance. You will then need to email the write-up to an officer 
        for approval before getting the points signed off and just include the picture with that. 
        And then once you've written that and after the officers have approved it, you can bring your
        point sheet to the next event you attend and have an officer sign your form then.
